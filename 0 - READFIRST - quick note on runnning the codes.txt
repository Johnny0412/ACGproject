Please run the codes with the sequence numbered on the front of the naming convention of the files:

It goes through from individual 5 subject areas in R and then the joining part in Julia and 
then finally linking the suburbs with the geocodes scrapped from API.

Some of the raw datasets are not available for automated downloading through the codes,
so please download the raw csv files from the separate folder "raw data - to run the codes" before running the all the codes.
